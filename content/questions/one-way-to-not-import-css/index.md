<!-- explanation -->

`Inline style` is usually used for `specificity` or practical purposes.  
`Link tag` is usually when you have a separate file for your css.  
`Style tag` are recommended to be inside the head block as recommended [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style)
